# 🚌 Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering Application** is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the collection, storage, and visualization of bus travel data across various state transport and private operators from the [Redbus](https://www.redbus.in/) website.

The project uses **Selenium** for dynamic web scraping, stores the data in a **SQL database**, and provides an **interactive Streamlit application** to filter and explore the data. This enables real-time insights into bus schedules, prices, availability, and more — empowering both end-users and stakeholders in the transportation domain.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The project aims to enhance the accessibility and usability of bus travel data by:
- Automating the extraction of Redbus route and schedule data.
- Providing interactive data filtering using Streamlit.
- Enabling better decision-making for travelers, aggregators, and analysts.

By streamlining these tasks, it significantly improves operational efficiency and supports strategic planning in the transport industry.

## 💼 Business Use Cases

- **Travel Aggregators**: Integrate real-time bus schedule and availability data.
- **Market Research**: Analyze demand trends, popular routes, and pricing.
- **Customer Support**: Provide users with tailored travel options.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Compare prices and services across operators.

## 🧭 Approach

### 1. Web Scraping
- Use **Selenium** to automate browser actions.
- Navigate through state transport corporation routes.
- Scroll dynamically to handle **lazy loading**.
- Click sub-tabs for **government buses** (e.g., KSRTC, APSRTC).
- Extract bus-level details from each route.

### 2. SQL Data Storage
- Create schema with correct data types.
- Use `sqlite3` or `mysql-connector-python` to store the data.
- Ensure deduplication and data quality.

### 3. Streamlit App
- Connect the app to the database.
- Use **Streamlit widgets** to filter by:
  - Route Name
  - Bus Type
  - Price Range
  - Star Rating
  - Availability
- Display the filtered data in a clean table.

---

## 📈 Results

- ✅ Scraped data from **10+ Government Transport Systems** (e.g., KSRTC, APSRTC).
- ✅ Included private bus details from selected routes.
- ✅ Successfully stored data in structured SQL format.
- ✅ Built an intuitive **Streamlit interface** for dynamic filtering.
